# ReadMe Generator Project 

Project Demonstration: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fRtg--grsX-6-XZ0Glm44kB76s9OOHgV/view

<hr>

This project was created for the intents and purposes of utilizing ECMAScript 6 (ES6) programming. The objective of the project was for the user to be able to generate a good ReadMe file from using a JS file. Execution of this requires that we: <ul>
<li> Utilize npm packages to generate the prompts and writing files
<li> Making use of the Template Literals to insert user input into a ReadMe template
<li> Troubleshooting errors along the way
+
</ul>

The project is done through the use of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and aide from [NPM documentations](https://www.npmjs.com/).
